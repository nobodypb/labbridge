# Acceptance status

This is a development baseline, not a fully commissioned battery-test system.

## Automated acceptance

- 20 portable C++ behavior executables cover framing, queued transactions,
  connection changes, resource validation, driver identity, leases, idempotency,
  local guards, per-activation deadlines, interlock feedback and temperature.
- Python tests validate actual runtime responses against OpenAPI, generated
  request models, USB chunk framing, distributed lease rollback and error
  propagation. Host tests include both chemistries through complete simulated
  cycles, cleanup and reboot rejection, plus the CLI.
- The frozen baseline's codec/controller and 13 Python tests remain mandatory.
- Three UI policy tests and five browser scenarios cover Wi-Fi scan/select/PSK,
  operation polling, lease/output behavior, unknown-state STOP and mixed modules.
- CI regenerates the API, checks drift, builds Python/TypeScript/C and firmware
  for StickS3, ESP32-S3-USB-OTG and classic ESP32. Board builds do not establish
  that every peripheral combination has been physically commissioned.
- LB-018 documents all 38 operations, 40 schemas, parameters and inline fields;
  shared reference fields use the referenced schema documentation. Generated
  Python/TypeScript descriptions and deterministic regeneration were checked.
  The annotation regression test preserves public prose and firmware property
  names/constraints while excluding prose/examples from ESP validation data.
  This documentation update required no hardware writes or flashing.

## DL24M bench acceptance

New asynchronous runtime on StickS3; actual display firmware Ver 2.0. Bench source
24 V, current limited to 1 A; bridge limits 25 V / 0.2 A / 5 W; CC 0.100 A.

- All 22 audited register queries answered over BLE.
- 33 setting/output/counter operations succeeded with fresh readback and bounded
  bridge recovery. CC 0.150 → 0.100 A, a measured 23.992 V / 0.101 A pulse, then
  independent OFF were included. All 14 setting families were changed/restored.
- Median host operation latency 0.851 s, maximum 1.655 s in that run. The timer
  required three writes on change and restoration; some other operations needed
  an extra write/read. The caller received successful confirmed operations.
- All three inactive setpoint banks were read, changed by one raw unit, restored,
  and returned to CC with the original CC target. Active non-CC regulation is
  intentionally uncommissioned and cannot be enabled through this driver.
- Original settings, CC 0.100 A and confirmed output OFF were restored. OVP was
  temporarily raised from its original 21 V to 25 V for the 24 V pulse, then
  restored to 21 V. Counter reset was explicitly authorized.

## Remaining physical acceptance

- Local lease expiry confirmed OFF on the final runtime. Reset during ON returned
  confirmed OFF without resuming. Reset during a multi-setting operation restored
  the original values. All 14 settings were subsequently re-read and matched;
  CC 0.100 A and OFF were confirmed. New-firmware USB Wi-Fi scan completed.
- Open-AP UI scan/select/PSK was confirmed by the operator in the earlier setup;
  new UI browser tests pass. Actual STA provisioning/reconnect needs a configured
  target network; it is not established by browser fixtures.
- Commission RD6024 serial identity, CC/CV register behavior and verified writes
  on actual sources; determine the optional Bluetooth module's transport.
- Commission relay polarity, feedback, power-up behavior, Kelvin voltage sensing,
  source reverse-current protection and external cell probe before any battery run.

Hardware acceptance stays open in LB-014; no simulated result closes it.


## Component and optional-meter extension

Portable checks cover source/sink routing, multiple actors on one physical
device, independently addressed STOP/state, signed scalar readings and common
external-temperature guards. Both chemistries complete direct-output and feedback
routing scenarios. An inline signed meter contributes capacity/energy; additional
temperature logging, stale-meter cleanup and reboot boundaries are checked.
Native Yocto USB is exercised through the generated API with injected SDK data;
the installed official SDK imports and the offline path returns unavailable.
INA228 tests cover identity, calibration, signed current/charge, conversion-ready,
overflow and freshness. Five browser scenarios include a composite source and a
read-only meter. Actual INA228 shunt accuracy, Yocto USB/network sampling and
all new sensor wiring remain uncommissioned. No new battery hardware run occurred.


The common component routes were also exercised on the physical StickS3/DL24M:
discovery, actor state and scalar readings, then eight verified operations
(current 0.150/0.100 A, cutoff 0.8/0.7 V, timer 60/0 s, bounded ON and independent
component STOP). Confirmations use A/V/s with units. The pulse measured 23.990 V /
0.100 A. All 14 original settings, CC 0.100 A and confirmed OFF were restored;
22/22 audited registers remained valid. This extends the DL24M evidence and does
not commission the optional new meter hardware.


## RD6018 AP extension (LB-019)

Portable tests cover ordinary RD6018/RD6024 selection and ceilings, explicit
RD6018P rejection, independent identities/two sources, corrupt/fragmented RTU
frames, duplicate/wrong-model binding, interrupted ON without replay, provisioning
packet vectors/checksums and session/phase/replay/deadline behavior. Generated
CLI tests exercise provisioning requests and usable USB token pairing; browser scenarios cover physical-OFF
confirmation, both phases, cancellation and ETag/explicit-limit registration.
The StickS3 firmware builds with the AP TCP service and provisioning sender.

Actual RD pairing, setpoint/output readback, fault tests and full coexistence
acceptance remain open until performed. This must not be inferred from simulated
sources. The read-only acceptance runner requires configured TCP sources, BLE
DL24M and an active station connection:

```sh
python tools/rd_wifi_acceptance.py --endpoint serial:/dev/ttyACM0 --source source-a --load load --output results/rd-ap-soak
# Add --source source-b when its Wi-Fi module is available. Default duration: 3600 s.
```

It records boot IDs, measurement freshness, configuration and connection counters;
an unexpected disconnect/rejection, stale sample or restart fails the run. Files
contain hardware identities and remain ignored/private. Active bench writes and
intentional fault injection are separate checks; this runner makes no mutations.

Initial general-profile broadcasts did not establish W01 pairing. Radio
submission/completion counts alone do not prove receiver acceptance. Switching
to WPA2 alone did not resolve the general sender's protocol differences.

Offline PC-profile checks independently verified all 256 CRC table entries
and synthetic phase-one/phase-two payloads, including per-triple CRC and total
XOR. Vendor binaries/decompiled sources are excluded. These checks establish
encoder consistency, not RF delivery.

Physical W01/RD6018 pairing with the PC-compatible profile was verified:
displayed server address, a new UDP join result, TCP model/firmware identity and
completed setup. The first incoming socket can time out before identity; a
subsequent connection succeeded. This is provisioning evidence, not source
output/readback, configured-source STOP or full coexistence acceptance.

The optional target-SSID profile changes only phase one's SSID field;
phase two remains identical. Codec and generated-client tests cover that
invariance. The default remains the PC-compatible profile.
